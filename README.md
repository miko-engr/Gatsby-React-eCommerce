## eCommerce Professional (Beta)

eCommerce Professional provides a way to quickly get up and running with a fully configurable Gatsby E Commerce site.

Out of the box, the site uses completely static data coming from a provider at `providers/inventoryProvider.js`. You can update this provider to fetch data from any real API by changing the call in the `getInventory` function.



> This project is still in Beta.

### Getting started

1. Clone the project

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/miko-engr/Gatsby-React-eCommerce.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```sh
$ yarn

# or

$ npm install
```

3. Run the project

```sh
$ gatsby develop

# or to build

$ gatsby build
```


## About the project

### Tailwind

This project is styled using Tailwind. To learn more how this works, check out the Tailwind documentation [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

### Components

The main files, components, and images you may want to change / modify are:

__Logo__ - src/images/logo.png   
__Buttons, Nav, Header__ - src/components   
__Form components__ - src/components/formComponents   
__Context (state)__ - src/context/mainContext.js   
__Pages (admin, cart, checkout, index)__ - src/pages   
__Templates (category view, single item view, inventory views)__ - src/templates   

### How it works

As it is set up, inventory is fetched from a local hard coded array of inventory items. This can easily be configured to instead be fetched from a remote source like Shopify or another CMS or data source by changing the inventory provider.

#### Configuring inventory provider

Update __providers/inventoryProvider.js__ with your own inventory provider.

#### Download images at build time

If you change the provider to fetch images from a remote source, you may choose to also download the images locally at build time to improve performance. Here is an example of some code that should work for this use case:

```javascript
import fs from 'fs'
import axios from 'axios'
import path from 'path'

function getImageKey(url) {
  const split = url.split('/')
  const key = split[split.length - 1]
  const keyItems = key.split('?')
  const imageKey = keyItems[0]
  return imageKey
}

function getPathName(url, pathName = 'downloads') {
  let reqPath = path.join(__dirname, '..')
  let key = getImageKey(url)
  key = key.replace(/%/g, "")
  const rawPath = `${reqPath}/public/${pathName}/${key}`
  return rawPath
}

async function downloadImage (url) {
  return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
    const path = getPathName(url)
    const writer = fs.createWriteStream(path)
    const response = await axios({
      url,
      method: 'GET',
      responseType: 'stream'
    })
    response.data.pipe(writer)
    writer.on('finish', resolve)
    writer.on('error', reject)
  })
}

export default downloadImage
```

You can use this function in __gatsby-node.esm.js__, map over the inventory data after fetching and replace the image paths with a reference to the location of the downloaded images, probably would look something like this:

```javascript
await Promise.all(
  inventory.map(async (item, index) => {
    try {
      const relativeUrl = `../downloads/${item.image}`
      if (!fs.existsSync(`${__dirname}/public/downloads/${item.image}`)) {
        await downloadImage(image)
      }
      inventory[index].image = relativeUrl
    } catch (err) {
      console.log('error downloading image: ', err)
    }
  })
)
```

### Updating with Auth / Admin panel

1. Update __src/pages/admin.js__ with sign up, sign, in, sign out, and confirm sign in methods.

2. Update __src/templates/ViewInventory.js__ with methods to interact with the actual inventory API.

3. Update __src/components/formComponents/AddInventory.js__ with methods to add item to actual inventory API.
